# fireboy-and-watergirl
Description:
The name of my term project is Fireboy and Watergirl. I have replicated the original Fireboy and Watergirl game in 
which the two characters are able to be controlled simultaneously to work together and overcome obstacles in order to 
complete varying levels.

How to Run:
The only file that needs to be run for this project is the main file "fireboy-and-watergirl.py". This file contains all 
the code necessary to run the project. However there is also a folder named "images" that contains all the images that 
are used in this program. In order for these images to open correctly, this images folder should be placed on the same 
folder level as the fireboy-and-watergirl file.

Libraries:
My project does not install any libraries.

Shortcut Commands:
My project does not include any shortcut commands.
